## üî• Introduction
Speech anti-spoofing aims to distinguish real speech from fake speech generated by Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Conversion (VC) systems. This project proposes a **joint optimization and transfer learning framework** to enhance the robustness of speech anti-spoofing countermeasures under various noise and reverberation conditions.

## üìÇ Dataset and Experimental Data
- ### TODO
- Upload noisy test data and corresponding instructions.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Requirements
To reproduce the experiments, install the following dependencies:

- Python ‚â• 3.8; PyTorch with CUDA (recommended) and matching Torchaudio
- Other dependencies: see `requirements.txt`

```bash
# Create and activate conda env
conda create -n secm python=3.8
conda activate secm

# Install PyTorch + Torchaudio
# CUDA 11.8
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# Project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Installation & Usage
### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikou-austin/SECM-Joint.git
cd SECM-Joint
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2. Prepare the dataset**
Download the dataset and place it under the `data/` directory.

Expected files (ASVspoof 2019 LA example):
- `data/spoof19LA/train/{wav.scp, utt2label}`
- `data/spoof19LA/dev/{wav.scp, utt2label}`
- `data/spoof19LA/eval/wav.scp`
- `data/aug/musan_*.txt`
  
### **3. Train the model**
```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

### **4. Evaluate the model**
```bash
python evaluate.py --checkpoint checkpoints/model.pth
```
