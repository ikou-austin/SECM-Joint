## 🔥 Introduction
Speech anti-spoofing aims to distinguish real speech from fake speech generated by Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Conversion (VC) systems. This project proposes a **joint optimization and transfer learning framework** to enhance the robustness of speech anti-spoofing countermeasures under various noise and reverberation conditions.
